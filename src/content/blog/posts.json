      "content": "# 🚀 Day 1: What is Software Quality Assurance (SQA)?\n\nSoftware Quality Assurance (SQA) is the backbone of delivering high-quality software. It ensures that software meets the required standards, functions correctly, and provides a seamless user experience.\n\n## 🔍 Why is SQA Important?\n\n✅ Prevents defects rather than just detecting them\n✅ Reduces development costs by identifying issues early\n✅ Enhances software reliability and performance\n✅ Improves user satisfaction and trust\n\n## 🎯 Key Responsibilities of an SQA Engineer\n\n🔹 Understanding project requirements and business needs\n🔹 Designing and executing test plans and test cases\n🔹 Identifying, reporting, and tracking software defects\n🔹 Ensuring compliance with industry standards and best practices\n\n## 💡 Final Thought\n\nSQA is not just about finding bugs—it's about **delivering a high-quality product** that meets both business and user expectations. Stay tuned as we dive deeper into the world of software testing in the next 30 days!"

      "content": "# 🚀 Day 2: Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) & Testing Life Cycle (STLC)\n\nUnderstanding **SDLC** and **STLC** is crucial for every QA engineer. These processes ensure software is developed and tested efficiently.\n\n## 🔄 What is SDLC?\nSoftware Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is the structured process of building software, ensuring quality and efficiency.\n\n## 🛠️ Phases of SDLC:\n1️⃣ **Requirement Analysis** – Understanding business needs\n2️⃣ **Planning** – Defining project scope and timeline\n3️⃣ **Design** – Creating architecture and UI/UX\n4️⃣ **Development** – Writing and implementing code\n5️⃣ **Testing** – Ensuring quality before release\n6️⃣ **Deployment** – Releasing the software to users\n7️⃣ **Maintenance** – Bug fixes and updates\n\n## 🔍 What is STLC?\nSoftware Testing Life Cycle (STLC) is the process QA engineers follow to ensure software meets quality standards.\n\n## 📌 Phases of STLC:\n1️⃣ **Requirement Analysis** – Understanding test needs\n2️⃣ **Test Planning** – Defining test scope, tools, and timelines\n3️⃣ **Test Case Development** – Writing detailed test cases\n4️⃣ **Test Environment Setup** – Preparing testing infrastructure\n5️⃣ **Test Execution** – Running tests and logging defects\n6️⃣ **Test Closure** – Reviewing reports and improving processes\n\n## 💡 Final Thought\nSDLC ensures software is built **systematically**, while STLC ensures it is **tested thoroughly**. Mastering both helps you become an efficient QA engineer."
