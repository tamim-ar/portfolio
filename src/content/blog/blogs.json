      "content": "# 🚀 Day 3: Types of Software Testing\n\nSoftware testing is broadly categorized into different types to ensure the software meets functional and non-functional requirements.\n\n## 🔹 Manual vs. Automation Testing\n✅ **Manual Testing** – Performed by QA engineers without automation tools. Best for exploratory, usability, and ad-hoc testing.\n✅ **Automation Testing** – Uses scripts and tools to execute test cases. Ideal for regression, load, and performance testing.\n\n## 🔍 Functional vs. Non-Functional Testing\n📌 **Functional Testing** – Verifies that the software works as expected.\n- **Unit Testing** – Tests individual components.\n- **Integration Testing** – Checks interaction between modules.\n- **System Testing** – Tests the complete application.\n- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)** – Validates if the software meets business needs.\n\n📌 **Non-Functional Testing** – Evaluates performance, security, and usability.\n- **Performance Testing** – Measures system speed and stability.\n- **Security Testing** – Identifies vulnerabilities.\n- **Usability Testing** – Ensures user-friendliness.\n- **Compatibility Testing** – Checks system behavior on different devices and browsers.\n\n## 💡 Final Thought\nEach testing type plays a vital role in ensuring a robust and high-quality product. Understanding these types helps QA engineers pick the right approach for each project."
