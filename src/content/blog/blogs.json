      "content": "# 🚀 Day 3: Types of Software Testing\n\nSoftware testing is broadly categorized into different types to ensure the software meets functional and non-functional requirements.\n\n## 🔹 Manual vs. Automation Testing\n✅ **Manual Testing** – Performed by QA engineers without automation tools. Best for exploratory, usability, and ad-hoc testing.\n✅ **Automation Testing** – Uses scripts and tools to execute test cases. Ideal for regression, load, and performance testing.\n\n## 🔍 Functional vs. Non-Functional Testing\n📌 **Functional Testing** – Verifies that the software works as expected.\n- **Unit Testing** – Tests individual components.\n- **Integration Testing** – Checks interaction between modules.\n- **System Testing** – Tests the complete application.\n- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)** – Validates if the software meets business needs.\n\n📌 **Non-Functional Testing** – Evaluates performance, security, and usability.\n- **Performance Testing** – Measures system speed and stability.\n- **Security Testing** – Identifies vulnerabilities.\n- **Usability Testing** – Ensures user-friendliness.\n- **Compatibility Testing** – Checks system behavior on different devices and browsers.\n\n## 💡 Final Thought\nEach testing type plays a vital role in ensuring a robust and high-quality product. Understanding these types helps QA engineers pick the right approach for each project."

      "content": "# 🚀 Day 4: White Box vs. Black Box Testing\n\nUnderstanding testing approaches is crucial for efficient software quality assurance. The two main techniques are **White Box Testing** and **Black Box Testing**.\n\n## 🔍 What is White Box Testing?\nWhite Box Testing (also called **Glass Box, Clear Box, or Structural Testing**) focuses on **internal code structure, logic, and flow**.\n\n### ✅ Key Characteristics:\n- Requires knowledge of programming and internal code structure\n- Used for **Unit Testing**, **Code Coverage Analysis**, and **Security Testing**\n- Performed by **developers or testers with coding skills**\n\n### ✅ Common Techniques:\n- **Statement Coverage** – Ensures every line of code is executed\n- **Branch Coverage** – Tests all decision points (if-else conditions)\n- **Path Coverage** – Verifies all possible execution paths\n\n## 🔍 What is Black Box Testing?\nBlack Box Testing focuses on **functionality** without needing to know the internal code.\n\n### ✅ Key Characteristics:\n- Does not require coding knowledge\n- Used for **System Testing, Regression Testing, and User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**\n- Performed by **manual testers and QA engineers**\n\n### ✅ Common Techniques:\n- **Equivalence Partitioning** – Divides input data into valid/invalid groups for testing\n- **Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)** – Tests values at the edges of input ranges\n- **Error Guessing** – Based on past experience and common error patterns\n\n## ⚡ Which One to Use?\n- **White Box Testing** → Best for developers and early defect detection\n- **Black Box Testing** → Best for testers ensuring functionality meets user expectations\n\n## 💡 Final Thought\nBoth techniques are essential for delivering a bug-free, high-quality product.
