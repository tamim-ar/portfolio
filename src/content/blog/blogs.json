Understanding their differences helps in writing effective test plans.\n\n### **📌 What is a Test Case?**\nA **test case** is a detailed document that outlines specific steps to verify a functionality of the software. It includes:\n\n- **Test Case ID** – Unique identifier\n- **Test Description** – What is being tested\n- **Preconditions** – Requirements before execution\n- **Test Steps** – Step-by-step actions to perform\n- **Expected Result** – The correct outcome\n- **Actual Result** – The observed outcome\n- **Status** – Pass/Fail\n\n**Example:**\n- Test Case: Verify login with valid credentials\n- Steps:\n  1️⃣ Open the login page\n  2️⃣ Enter a valid username and password\n  3️⃣ Click on the \"Login\" button\n- Expected Result: The user should be logged in successfully\n\n### **📌 What is a Test Scenario?**\nA **test scenario** is a high-level description of what needs to be tested. It focuses on real-world usage rather than step-by-step execution.\n\n**Example:**\n- Scenario: Verify the login functionality of a website\n- Test Cases under this scenario:\n  - Login with valid credentials\n  - Login with invalid credentials\n  - Login with an empty password field\n\n### **📌 What is a Test Script?**\nA **test script** is an automated set of instructions written in a scripting language to execute test cases automatically.\n\n**Example (Selenium - Java):**\nA simple script to automate login testing:\n```java\nWebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();\ndriver.get(\"https://example.com/login\");\ndriver.findElement(By.id(\"username\")).sendKeys(\"testuser\");\ndriver.findElement(By.id(\"password\")).sendKeys(\"password123\");\ndriver.findElement(By.id(\"loginButton\")).click();\n```\n\n### **⚡ Key Differences:**\nA **test case** is a detailed step-by-step guide, a **test scenario** is a broader testing idea, and a **test script** is an automated version of a test case.\n\n### **💡 Final Thought**\nWriting well-structured test cases and scenarios ensures effective manual and automated testing. Mastering them is essential for a successful QA career.\n\n#SoftwareTesting #QA #TestCase #TestScenario #TestScript #AutomationTesting #ManualTesting #QualityAssurance #SoftwareQuality"
